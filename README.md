# adaptive_cruise_control

Used MATLAB and Simulink environment to develop and implement an adaptive cruise control system for vehicles that automatically adjusts the vehicle speed to maintain a safe distance from vehicles ahead. The idea of building an Adaptive Cruise Control aims to let the driver in a host car set a traveling speed and automatically maintain a constant distance from the preceding car with the help of ultrasonic sensor. This project comprises of ACC system operating at moderate to high velocity,40 and above.
